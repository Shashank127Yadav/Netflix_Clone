Features
Responsive Design: The Netflix homepage clone is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Flexbox and Grid Layout: Flexbox and Grid Layout are used to create a flexible and fluid design, making it easier to handle different screen sizes and layouts.

Custom Styling: While the overall structure is based on the Netflix homepage, the styling has been customized to provide a unique touch. Feel free to experiment with colors, fonts, and other design elements to make it your own.
